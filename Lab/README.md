# SBA 316 DOM Manipulation

This project is a basic task list built with JavaScript using DOM manipulation.  
The purpose of the assignment was to practice working with the DOM, events, and user interaction without using any frameworks.

## What the app does

- Lets the user add tasks using a form
- Prevents submitting empty tasks
- Allows tasks to be marked complete by clicking on them
- Allows tasks to be deleted with a confirmation popup
- Shows how many tasks are completed out of the total

## What I used

- createElement and appendChild
- getElementById and querySelectorAll
- Event listeners for submit and click
- classList to toggle completed tasks
- Basic form validation
- window.confirm for delete confirmation

## How to use

1. Type a task into the input
2. Click Add to add it to the list
3. Click a task to mark it completed
4. Click Delete to remove a task
